# Colls

Small, dependency-free collection utilities for Java 25. Currently provides a generic, fixed-size, overwrite-on-full `RingBuffer<T>` with queue semantics.

## Build and test locally
```bash
mvn verify
```
This compiles, runs tests, and produces jars (main, sources, javadocs) under `target/`.
